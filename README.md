Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile

Form Validation: Client-side validation for all forms

Error Handling: User-friendly error messages

Backend (Spring Boot)
RESTful API: Clean, well-documented endpoints

JWT Authentication: Secure token-based authentication

Database Integration: PostgreSQL/MySQL with Hibernate

Role-Based Authorization: Fine-grained access control

Data Validation: Robust server-side validation

Audit Logging: Track all inventory changes

API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI support

Error Handling: Consistent error responses
